Very much in flux, at the moment.

`npm install` should satisfy dependencies. However, you'll still need to checkout the latest voxel-server and modify index.js to point to it.

Then run the server with `node index.js`

My ultimate goal:

* Have a game server I can self-host
* With a persistent world (backed by mysql, likely)
* So I can invite friends and members of my meetup to play around
